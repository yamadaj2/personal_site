        This is a simple Object Orientated Game used as an exercise to become more fluent with many Object
        Orientated Concepts. Much effort was put in to ensure the code was clean as it could be. This includes
        using <em>intent revealing</em> variable and method names, <em>small single purpose</em> methods, neatly organised classes, DRY code and unit tests.
      </p>
      <p>
        Much of the practices on clean code was taken from the book <cite>"Clean Code"</cite> by Robert C. Martin
